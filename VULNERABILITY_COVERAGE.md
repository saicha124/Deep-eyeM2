## Example Report Output

When you scan a target and find vulnerabilities, the report will show:

```
Information Disclosure
🕐 Discovered: 2025-11-04 10:30:15

Severity: HIGH
URL: https://example.com/product?id=invalid
Description: Sensitive information exposed in response
Evidence: Stack trace/error details exposed

🛡️ How to Fix This Vulnerability
Priority: HIGH | ⏱️ Estimated Fix Time: 1-2 days

ERROR CODE REFERENCE:
- CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information

COMMON ERROR CODES EXPOSED:
- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with full stack trace
- Database errors: "MySQL Error 1054: Unknown column 'password' in users table"
- Framework errors revealing file paths

SOLUTION - Disable Information Disclosure:

1. DISABLE DEBUG MODE IN PRODUCTION:
   - Python/Flask: app.config['DEBUG'] = False
   - Django: DEBUG = False in settings.py
   - Node.js: NODE_ENV=production
   - PHP: display_errors = Off in php.ini

2. IMPLEMENT CUSTOM ERROR HANDLERS:
   - Catch all exceptions and return generic error messages
   - Log detailed errors server-side only
   - Never expose stack traces to users

Code Examples:
# Bad (Vulnerable):
try:
    product = get_product(product_id)
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error: {str(e)}\n{traceback.format_exc()}", 500

# Good (Secure):
import logging
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_error(error):
    logging.error(f"Error: {error}", exc_info=True)
    return {"error": "An error occurred"}, 500
